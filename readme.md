# Learn For Good
## Process & Features Repo

This repository is a general location for discussion of how Learn For Good operates and the features we would like to add to our software development process.

While this sort of discussion would traditionally be served by a web-based forum or a mailing list, Github has many features to facilitate conversations, comments, and collaboration. This is an experiment in using those features to their fullest capacity while also being an opportunity for LFG members to become more comfortable working in git and Github.
